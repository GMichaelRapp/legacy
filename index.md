### What Is a Roleplaying Game?
If roleplaying games are new to you, they can feel daunting when attempting to tackle them as a gaming concept. Don't worry, though. Roleplaying games are quite easy to understand conceptually: They are about friendly collaboration between multiple players, including the player known as the Referee (REF), and they are about playing a fictional role or taking on a fictional role within a large, collective narrative world or universe. 

Collaboration is key here. Collaboration is a form of entertainment, and it is a way to produce exciting outcomes and not boring, uneventful gaming experiences. Quite the opposite. Collaboration between players is the best way to develop each player character (PC), explore the narrative space (i.e., the game's world or universe), and craft wonderful, enriching experiences that will stick with each player, even the REF. 

### What *Is* Needed for Successful Gameplay?
Like most roleplaying games on the market, players will need the following items and supplies for successful gameplay:
- Two (2) ten-sided dice
- Pens, pencils, and highlighters
- Scratch paper, 5x8-inch notecards, or even notebook paper
- A variety of colored poker chips, pennies, or glass gemstones
- These rules
- A place to play (e.g., a large room, Discord server, convention area, etc.)
- Time to play (45+ minutes minimum)

### The Core Mechanic
Everything a player character might possibly attempt that **could** result in **consequential failure** is accomplished by testing the character in question through a YES, NO, or MAYBE assessment. Depending on the character's stats and available **action points**, they can perform an action automatically (**YES**), after spending the requisite action points, resolving the conflict or solving the problem at hand (automatically). Characters might lack the necessary action points and/or stats that allow them to take action (**NO**), which means they could be facing some serious trouble. The third option results in a need to roll two (2) ten-sided dice, referred to as the **d100**, which means there is a serious chance of failure (**MAYBE**). The player under the third option will spend the requisite action points, and then they will roll dice to determine if they have succeeded or failed at a given task. 

> The YES (✓), NO (✘), and MAYBE (?) assessment is at the heart of all ***consequential*** actions taken within the game. **YES** indicates automatic success in certain areas, if the player has enough action points to spend to make it happen. **NO** indicates automatic failure if attempted or the character cannot possibly takcle the problem/task, as they don't have the means to do so, even if they have action points to spend. **MAYBE** indicates there is some chance concerning whether a character will be successful or unsuccessful. Again, this means a player must spend action points and then roll against a predetermined target number to see if they have succeeded or failed in their task.
